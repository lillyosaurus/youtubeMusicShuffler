# youtubeMusicShuffler
This repository hosts the back end for a web tool I developed to shuffle you tube music playlists

I was not happy with the yutube music shuffling program as it always seemed to select the same songs from my playlists. This repository creates a web interface for a python tool that i developed which implements my own shuffling algorthm for youtube music. This program will shuffle a playist by importing the playlist randomizing the order then requesting that the youtube server replace the existing playlist with the shuffled version. Users can then listen to the playlist in order and the tracks will be randomized.
